Ranger ces notes
================

Zettelkasten is the *latest craze*. We should figure out a way
to capitalize on this to improve `ranger`'s popularity. 

User quotes which corroborate my claims:

> I love taking notes, if only ranger supported
> [my workflow](https://xkcd.com/1172/)

> Ranger's great and all but I don't care about managing files,
> only my zettelkasten.

Scheme the First
----------------

Ranger would make an **ideal** zettelkasten interface.

```python
# TODO: Remove all the useless file managing features.
```
